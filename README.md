## Takwax:
Takwax is the [Munsee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/takwax) word for Turtle üê¢

The world is said to have been created on the back of a turtle as a place for sky-woman to live when she came down from the sky-world.

Thus I have decided to name this project `Takwax` as I intend to use it as a foundation and system for the creation of future projects.

This first iteration of takwax is a static website creation tool.
